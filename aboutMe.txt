My name is Ryan Hunter and I am double majoring in
Math and Computer Science at Santa Clara. I am
currently a Junior and just transferred her this
last Winter quarter. In my free time (pre-covid) I
like to go out and eat at fun restaurants and go
to comedy clubs. I also enjoy listening to podcasts
as well as lecture series from universities like 
Stanford and Harvard that are posted youtube.
